# IdeaBrowser Integration & Idea-Centric Platform

## Product Requirements Page (PRP)

### Executive Summary
Transform IdeaConnect from a generic social networking platform into an idea-centric collaboration platform that automatically syncs daily startup ideas from IdeaBrowser.com and facilitates team formation around specific ideas.

### Problem Statement
Current entrepreneurial platforms focus on networking rather than ideas themselves. Entrepreneurs need a platform where:
- High-quality startup ideas are continuously sourced and featured
- Discussion and collaboration happen around specific ideas
- Team formation is organic and idea-driven
- Ideas are the primary focus, not generic social features

### Solution Overview
Build an integrated platform that:
1. Automatically syncs daily startup ideas from IdeaBrowser.com
2. Creates structured discussion spaces for each idea
3. Enables interest-based team formation
4. Centers the entire platform experience around ideas

  market_size TEXT,
  source_url TEXT,
  featured_date DATE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- User Interest tracking
CREATE TABLE user_interests (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  idea_id UUID REFERENCES ideas(id),
  interest_level INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, idea_id)
);

-- Discussion threads
CREATE TABLE idea_discussions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),

  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Teams formed around ideas
CREATE TABLE idea_teams (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  idea_id UUID REFERENCES ideas(id),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,

  created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Team memberships
CREATE TABLE team_members (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  team_id UUID REFERENCES idea_teams(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  role TEXT DEFAULT 'member',
  joined_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(team_id, user_id)
);
