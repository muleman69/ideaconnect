# IdeaConnect MVP Requirements

## Core Features for Initial Launch

# FEATURE:
Build an idea-centric collaboration platform where entrepreneurs can:
1. View daily startup ideas from IdeaBrowser.com
2. Raise their hand for specific ideas they want to build
3. Find teammates who are interested in the SAME ideas
4. Form teams around specific ideas
5. Collaborate on turning those ideas into real projects

The IDEAS are the centerpiece - everything revolves around Greg's daily ideas.

# EXAMPLES:
- Today's idea: "AI-powered meal planning app" 
- Users see the idea, read the details
- Users click "I want to build this" 
- Users see others who also want to build THIS specific idea
- Users form teams specifically for THIS idea
- Each idea has its own dedicated collaboration space

# DOCUMENTATION:
- IdeaBrowser.com structure and content format
- How to sync/import daily ideas (API or scraping)
- Idea discussion threads and team formation flows

# OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
- Ideas should be the main navigation (not generic user profiles)
- Each idea needs its own dedicated space for discussion and team formation
- User profiles should show "Ideas I'm interested in" and "Ideas I'm building"
- The platform should feel like "today's startup idea collaboration hub"
